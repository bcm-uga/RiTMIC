# Introduction

`RiTMIC` (**R**egulat**I**on of **T**umor **MI**croenvironment **C**omposition) is an open-access R package that simulates the tools necessary to `penda`, performs `penda` and applies visualization tools to the `penda` output. `penda` requires three matrices datasets : 
- The A matrix of proportion of cell lines distribution per tumor : Cellular proportion distribution in each This  gene deregulation in individual samples compared to a set of reference, control samples. `penda_1ctrl` is an adaptation of this method for a specific case, only one sample as reference. This particular experimental condition causes a loss of power, as long as possible use the classic version of Penda. This tutorial aims at providing to non-expert users basic informations and illustrations on how to run the package.
